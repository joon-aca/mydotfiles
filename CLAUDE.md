# CLAUDE.md — Project instructions for Claude Code

## Git commits
- Do NOT add AI credits (`Co-Authored-By: Claude` or similar) to commit messages.

## Code quality
- Focus on finding and fixing ROOT CAUSES, not symptoms. No hacky patches.
- No fake or hardcoded output — all output must be real and derived from actual logic.
- No shortcuts that paper over the real problem.
- No duplicated code — extract, reuse, consolidate.
- Align with the existing naming and coding conventions in the file/project.
- Write solid, production-quality code.

## Communication
- Do not say "You're absolutely right!", unless it's absolutely warranged.
