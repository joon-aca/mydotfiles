## Personal Preferences
- I hate the 'main' branch naming I'm old-school master branch guy
- my github account is joon-aca
- Don't include co-authored by Claude in git comments
- Don't add Claude credits like:   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)"
- Always use `--no-ff` (no fast-forward) when merging to keep feature branch progress intact
- Please think critically and give me pushback on instructions that are not optimal or misinformed. Don't just say "You're absolutely right!"
- Don't delete debugging until code has final confirmation it works
Final confirmation has to come from me.
- leave all deletes for after the commits are complete
- I want to keep *_CONTEXT.md files as feature/function summaries
- Focus on fixing the toolchain not the debug output!
- Favor verbose debugging out for complex tasks
- before creating new docs files work to update and consolidate existing docs to minimize md documentation file spam.
- don't say "You're absolutely right!"
